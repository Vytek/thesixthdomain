To convert the time-dependent model of search developed by Lawson, Cassidy, and Ratches into a Go function, we need to implement the equations described in the document. The equations we will use are:

\[ P = P_1 P_2 \]
\[ P_2 = 1 - e^{-\tau/(m t)} \]
\[ \tau = \frac{6.8}{N/N_{50}} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the probability of detection.
- \( P_1 \) is a probability factor that we need to define or compute separately.
- \( P_2 \) is the time-dependent probability of detection.
- \( \tau \) is a time constant dependent on the number of resolvable cycles.
- \( N \) is the number of resolvable cycles across the target.
- \( N_{50} \) is the number of cycles required for 50% detection probability.
- \( t \) is the observation time.
- \( m \) is a model-specific constant.

Here is the Go function implementing this model:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

// TimeDependentModel calculates the probability of detection using the time-dependent model of Lawson, Cassidy, and Ratches.
func TimeDependentModel(N, N50, t, m float64, P1 float64) float64 {
	// Calculate tau
	tau := 6.8 / (N / N50)
	
	// Calculate P2
	P2 := 1 - math.Exp(-tau/(m*t))
	
	// Calculate the total probability of detection
	P := P1 * P2
	
	return P
}

func main() {
	// Example values for the variables
	N := 10.0       // Number of resolvable cycles
	N50 := 5.0      // Number of cycles for 50% detection
	t := 60.0       // Observation time in seconds
	m := 2.0        // Model-specific constant
	P1 := 0.8       // Example value for P1

	// Calculate the probability of detection
	probability := TimeDependentModel(N, N50, t, m, P1)

	fmt.Printf("Probability of detection: %.4f\n", probability)
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **TimeDependentModel Function:**
   - Calculates the time constant \(\tau\).
   - Computes \(P_2\) using the given formula.
   - Computes the total probability of detection \(P\) as the product of \(P_1\) and \(P_2\).

2. **Main Function:**
   - Provides example values for the variables.
   - Calls the `TimeDependentModel` function to compute the probability of detection.
   - Prints the result.

You can adjust the values of \(N\), \(N_{50}\), \(t\), \(m\), and \(P_1\) based on the specific scenario or data you have.
